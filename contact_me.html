<!--FAQs text and information-->
<h1>FAQs</h1>
<h3>How do you charge your photography sessions?</h3>
<p>I have two options with how I charge for my sessions. By the hour and the whole day. Generally, the by the hour option is accustomed to my general and portrait options, 
and as well my others option depending on the situation. For my whole day sessions, those are generally for the wedding or special event options, due to how those types of events operate with people wanting the most out of those days. 
These options are not set in stone though so if one wants to say for instance choose hourly for a special event then they can do so as they please, just know that will be the schedule I will work upon for the day, 
and I cannot accommodate too any last-minute changes as I may be dealing with multiple clienteles during the days.</p>
<h3>Do I have to pay extra for specific photoshoot events?</h3>
<p>Yes, depending on the type of photoshoot I will charge extra, but please keep in mind this is not just for the sake of me doing it. I must take account for what type of equipment and more that I will need depending on the situation, 
so for instance say I have an hourly wedding session, I will still charge the same extra charge even if the wedding session was for a whole day because of the type of equipment and service that I am charging. Same goes for special event photoshoots, 
it all depends on just what type of event I will be in the service of.</p>
<h3>Can I reschedule/cancel a session?</h3>
<p>Yes, if you give the go ahead to reschedule/cancel a session at least 2 hours before the session then you can reschedule or cancel whatever the given session, be it a general or wedding photoshoot session.</p>
<h3>Which is the best way to contact you?</h3>
<p>To book a session with me you should first fill out the contact form that I have above so I can gather your correct contact information. I will then call you to confirm everything that was listed within the form, 
from the type of session and answer any questions involving the session. If you can't answer your phone when I call, then I will use the email provided to confirm everything from there. Generally, if any last-minute changes or questions pop up, 
then giving me a call with my business phone number will be the quickest way to contact me within my business hours. I rarely use my emails as my way of contact, but I still check them at in the beginning, middle, 
and end of the day so if you have any general questions or concerns and I don't answer within my business hours, then leaving me a email with the details will be the second best thing to do, just not the quickest since I check them three times a given day. 
I am most active with responding to emails on the weekends that are my days of rest, and I am using my business phone for those days, so please keep that in mind if you are trying to call me during the weekends.</p>
