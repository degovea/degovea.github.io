<p id="text_space">Looking for someone who can capture does special moments for special events in life? Look no further, as you are in the right place. Having experience with photoshoots in the past I am no stranger when it comes to the art of photography. 
It's a lot more then just “point and shoot”, especially when capturing those once in a lifetime moment in your life so it's important that you have everything right for the whole situation. I, Daniel Govea understand that perfectly, and that is why I provide the service of 
photography for those moments that people can have captured.</p>
