<p>Like almost anybody whenever they picked up their first camera, be it a handheld one or one that comes with a smart device, it was a avenue of a new way of storying memories. Here, in the first time in history can people share and distribute information so effortlessly without waiting for it too say come into the mail from the post office, but instead with just the tap of a button can you send it too a friend or loved one in a instant with no wait at all practically. Growing up in the age of technology can have a lot of drawbacks, but as well as having advantages as well. Before I ever had my first cellphone, I had a digital camera that my mom gave too me, and I remember having a absolute blast with it whenever I had it in my hands. Who knows how many batteries I used because of that camera growing up, but from that point on my curiosity of such a hobby turned into something more slowly as I grew older. My hobby turned into something that I loved doing more and more by the day as I came to understand about it, too the point where I got in a position that I could maybe make these feelings that I have for photography distributed out too more people in the form of handling their photoshoots too capturing moments in their lives. I want people to look back at the photos that I take for/of them with positive and loving emotions, the same emotions that hooked me in too photography for the first time whenever I looked at my first photo that I took.</p>
